Practical first steps:
- Check if we're actually doing GPU learning. Look at optimization CPU vs GPU
- Ramp up input dimension with more SNPs
  - Write dataset from ZARR
  - Transform ZARR for sample indexing
  - Reading samples from ZARR to GPU in Mini-Batches

Further reading:
- Checkpoint every ten epochs (check performance), overwriting last checkpoint
- Look at optimizers (Adam DONE)
- Think about/look for/code simple framework to store models, their hyperparameters and data about learning periods
