Practical first steps:
- Check error alignment between angles and age, make error estimate
- Do some large snp runs with slower learning rate decrease
- Simple autoencoder: snps -> 3 dims (color) -> snps
- Learn inverted features: age-location -> snps
- Combine to create movie: age-location -> snps -> 3 dims


Further reading:
- Checkpoint every ten epochs (check performance), overwriting last checkpoint
- Look at optimizers (Adam DONE)
- Think about/look for/code simple framework to store models, their hyperparameters and data about learning periods
