Practical first steps:
- Ramp up input dimension with more SNPs
  - Reading samples from ZARR to GPU in Mini-Batches, again with optimal type
    (which? it might need float bc. later steps? whats the type in the model)

Further reading:
- Checkpoint every ten epochs (check performance), overwriting last checkpoint
- Look at optimizers (Adam DONE)
- Think about/look for/code simple framework to store models, their hyperparameters and data about learning periods
